# Richard Steele 1607539 WebGl procedural mesh generation example

### Grids

* Both are procedurally generated, the lower one has simplex noise applied.

* Mesh sine wave is applied by the shader.

### Polyhedrons

* Rotate on x and y axis in relation to mouse/touch movement on x and y.

* Click mouse button/tap screen to subdivide the objects meshes.

* Be warned, large subdivisions will be slow! very large loops.

* Benchmarks on subdivision 5:  (subdivision 6 will be much longer)

* 42 seconds on my old thinkpad x220.

* <2 seconds on my new aero 15w.

* Left in larger subdivisions as a test, refresh page if you don't want to wait.

* New meshes replace the previous meshes, non-repeating vertices and indices list are procedurally generated.

* Parallax effect on everything when scrolling up and down.

* The intention of this WebGL canvas is to ultimately act as a background to my personal website.

* For example, the grids would act as section separators.

* That's also why I've left the aesthetic subtle. I could have made it colourful etc.

* But I like it.

## Adjust the window size and aspect to look nicest, and start scrolling down!
